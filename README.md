# WIFI_PasswordLogger

I am strongly against any malacious intent that someone would use this program for. It is for educational purposes only.
I am not responsible for anyones use of this.

This code is relatively simple and may be good for begineers to analyze or improve on. 

The concept or theory for this is, too run this on a computer that is connected to a password protected wifi
network, in order to pull the password of that network. Logs to txt file. 

Social engineering could be used IN THEORY, maybe someone COULD spoof this as a pdf file or other type of common file, and convince someone to open it that is on a password protected wifi network.

For best desired outcome, you can change the filpath for the 'f' variable at the end of the script. Or get rid of the filewriting all together and have some other way to get data back to you. Webhook, email etc. 

Again this is in no way for malicous intent. Just educational purposes. 

Usage Example: 
hypothetical situation : pentesting a company, maybe in the future you need to get on their network to conduct something like a mitm attack, or other variation. 

You could compile to executable, and spoof as a common file, then figure out a way too run on company computer. Maybe convincing someone to let you quickly borrow their computer, or sneaking into a office, and running it. Whatever it may be.

AGAIN: all of these are examples. Dont do illegal stuff. I am not responsible for anyones actions.
