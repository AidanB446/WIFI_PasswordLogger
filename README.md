# WIFI_PasswordLogger

I am strongly against any malacious intent that someone would use for this program. It is for educational purposes only

Simply gets the saved wifi passwords using powershell commands. Quickly gets them and logs all of them into a txt file in the working directory.

This could be used in theory, by compiling it into an exe, or some other windows native file, and throwing it onto a usb to be run on someone elses computer without them
knowing in order to get wifi key. Other data is pulled too. You could spoof the exe (or other native file) as like a image, or pdf, or whatever.
You can also edit it so it sends the 'msg' variable to you in an email, instead of saving it to a txt file. 

Again this is in no way for malicous intent. Just educational purposes. 

Usage: 
You can run the python file, or compile it to a executable, and spoof the file type like I said.
